# Google Sheets Integration Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help set up and manage the Google Sheets integration for the proposal submission form.

## Prerequisites

Before running these scripts, make sure you have:

1. Created a Google Cloud project
2. Enabled the Google Sheets API
3. Created a service account with appropriate permissions
4. Downloaded the service account key file

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Google Sheets Setup Guide](../docs/google-sheets-setup.md).

## Available Scripts

### create-google-sheet.js

This script creates a new Google Sheet with the appropriate headers for storing proposal submissions.

#### Setup

1. Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` in the root directory
2. Fill in your Google service account credentials in the `.env.local` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour Private Key Here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   ```
   (Leave the `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` field empty as it will be generated by the script)

#### Usage

Run the script using Node.js:

```bash
node scripts/create-google-sheet.js
```

The script will:
1. Create a new Google Sheet titled "Proposal Submissions"
2. Set up the header row with all the required fields
3. Output the Sheet ID, which you should add to your `.env.local` file

## After Running the Scripts

After successfully running the scripts and setting up your Google Sheet:

1. Make sure the `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in your `.env.local` file is set to the ID of the newly created sheet
2. Ensure the Google Sheet is shared with your service account email
3. Restart your development server to apply the changes

Your proposal submission form should now be fully integrated with Google Sheets!
